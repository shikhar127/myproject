## 🎯 Calculation Accuracy

This calculator implements the exact formulas used by:
- Income Tax Department of India
- EPFO (Employees' Provident Fund Organisation)
- ESIC (Employees' State Insurance Corporation)
- State government professional tax rules

**Formula for In-Hand Salary**:
```
Gross Salary = CTC - Employer PF - Gratuity - Employer Insurance

Taxable Income = Gross - Standard Deduction - Exemptions - Deductions

Income Tax = Slab Calculation + 4% Cess - Rebate (if applicable)

Monthly TDS = Annual Tax / 12

In-Hand = Gross Monthly - Employee PF - Professional Tax - TDS - ESI
```
